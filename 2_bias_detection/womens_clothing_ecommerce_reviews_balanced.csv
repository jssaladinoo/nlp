-1,Beautifully made shirt however the sizing is way off. the sleeves and across the chest are really tight while the rest of the shirt fits fine. if you get a size larger then the shirt in the body is to large. would recommend if you have really tiny shoulders  arms and chest. such a shame since i really love the shirt.,Blouses
-1,"The shirt is absolutely cute looking. but that's just that....looks. i'm 5'2"" size 6 & wears m to l top. i tried on the medium in the store  it was rather flowing. i liked it. but i didn't like how it fit on the underarm area. it hung very low. so i ordered a petite m. still the same. plus the store the lighting was dark so i didn't realize how see through the shirt was too. had to return it.",Blouses
-1,This top was a big disappointment. i ordered two of the grey motif with the print of the forest animals in size 16. neither of them fit well  but one was cut much smaller than the other. i've had this problem with all of the numerically-sized buttondown style of maeve tops. i don't understand why in size 14 & 16  this keeps happening. that's why i purchase two of each. usually one fits and the other doesn't. this time  unfortunately  neither worked. they both were too tight in the arms/shoulders,Blouses
-1,I ordered this top because it was 100 percent cotton and a cute design. when it arrived  i thought it was a cute  different top  uniquely designed. when i tried it on  it looked like a had several extra rolls due to the ruching and was very unflattering. it reminded me of the michelin man wearing extra tires and i am of a thin build so i did not like the perception of rolls throughout the bodice. unfortunately  it did not work for me. i wish retailer would include more cotton tops in their collect,Blouses
-1,This top is quite boxy and i was very disappointed with the color  it looked as if i'd washed it in filthy water. it's a very dingy white  needless to say it went back.,Blouses
-1,I liked the design and i didn't mind that is see through  but i couldn't put it on ! not size 8 what is my usual size   not size 10 or 12  even 14! my shoulders wouldn't go through the middle part and it is not stretchy   so disappointed. i really wanted to like it.,Blouses
-1,The pattern is very adorable. unfortunately the design is flawed. sizing is great at the waist and hip  and the length is spot on  but the top is wide. it's strange because i don't think it would fit someone that was bustier than me either.  will return. i'm considering buying again on sale and having a tailor correct it.,Blouses
-1,I just can't get past how different the blouse i got is from the photo. mine has dark colors  really dark colors.  this top fits a bit large and the neck is quite wide. i thought it flowed well and fit nicely in my regular size large. i liked the length and the fact that it's shorter than shown. it still covered my bum.  the back has a cute peplum ruffle and there are little bronze colored beads along the bottom edge in both the front and back. i would have kept it had been the blouse shown in t,Blouses
-1,I read all the reviews and was hoping that this top would work for me  but it did not. i ordered a size smaller than usual and it was still way too big. it was not flattering at all on my curvy frame. overall  it looked more like a maternity top on me then anything else! if you're tall and slender  i think this top would work!,Blouses
0,Cropped and wide- would look cuter on someone who is more petite. was too wide and cropped for me. very sheer.,Blouses
0,"Adorable top  but i have to agree with what two other reviewers said... that is is boxy and unflattering. i have a similar patterned top  also by maeve  but the sizing on that runs small  medium  large. the s petite that i have doesn't fit quite the same as the 4 petite in this blouse. this is definitely more ""square"" in the torso  and the ruffles do stick out more - very flouncy. it just made me look frumpy instead of the sexy date night look i was going for. i am 5' and 120 lbs. also  i didn't",Blouses
0,Like the previous reviewer  the biggest problem with this shirt is how short it is. i'm 5'4 and ordered a 12  which is usually what i wear at retailer. even only being 5'4  this shirt is much shorter than i anticipated. it fits everywhere else  though. i'm obsessed with the back so i'm going to keep it and wear it. i'd say it's worth it at the sale price.,Blouses
0,I received this yesterday and the fit for me is so strange...to tight in the bust and the arms were to big for me..i am so bummed...the arms do not stay on my shoulders. i have many tops but maeve and they fit me well..this is the first one i have to return. this top is made well and i do recommend  but it should be tried on before purchasing as it is pricey if it does not fit you!,Blouses
0,I'm 5'7  125lbs  and the small fits perfectly. the sleeves are the right length (i have long arms and legs)  and the body fits loosely  without looking sloppy. at my height  the small is not long enough to wear as a tunic  which is fine.    unfortunately  the shirt arrived with makeup stains around the laces and the inside of the shirt  so i had to wash it before wearing it.    i only purchased this shirt because it was on sale.,Blouses
0,Absolutely love this blouse but if your a woman cursed with larger arms for your body size than this is not for you. i couldn't get the lace part of the upper arms past my elbows.  oh well  it's going back!,Blouses
0,Nicely made  pretty details  but it's cropped fairly short and is rather boxy. wore with orange linen pants and it was cute!,Blouses
0,"Tried this lovely with high waste  wide leg  black flowy pants. everything i could hope for and more  but not quite!    size: blindly ordered size 6. i'm usually a small  occasionally xs in retailer brands like floreat and akemi+kin. i'm 5'5"" tall  130 lbs  34d  35-29-37  long torso  narrow shoulders  and short arms.    fit: size 6 had just enough space through the bust. the lace edged sleeves were roomy and just reached my wrists. the shoulders were just right. extra fabric ballooned out around t",Blouses
0,"The lace on this top is pretty  and i liked the way it was styled in the product photos  but did nothing for me on. between the loose sleeves and the boxy cut of the front  it just sort of hung shapelessly on me. i also found the back to be much shorter than 30.5""--it came to a few inches below my hips and was not tunic length like i expected. the shoulders fit me well  and because the top was boxy already  i didn't want to size up for length. for reference i tried on xs (i'm 5'4""  120 lbs).",Blouses
1,Swingy and just the right weight for the office. the cream is ever so slightly sheer but looks really good with a darker bra  even for the office because you can't really see through it. i'm wearing this all the time this fall and winter with skirts  black pants  and skinny jeans,Blouses
1,Love this top. the beautiful and delicate details are wonderful. the cut is a loose fit which is great. it works with tailored trousers and jeans,Blouses
1,My daughter tried on this shirt in new york & loved it so i ordered it for her for christmas1 i am thrilled  & she will be thrilled! love my purchase!,Blouses
1,I had the pleasure of trying this on today and looooooove it. i love all things bows  but usually they are off-centered over the left shoulder. i have a bit of an ocd thing  and i prefer things to be over my right shoulder so usually while i love them  i can't wear them. i love that this bow is in the middle-and i like that it is higher than the neckline of the shirt so you know there is some skin underneath. it adds to the sexiness of the blouse while also creating a more pleasing look. i feel,Blouses
1,I love this shirt! i wore it to a friend's baby shower and received a lot of compliments on it. the neckline and shoulders and very flattering  but then i'm not very busty  so maybe that's why it worked for me. the material is hand-wash only  but well worth it for such a unique  pretty top. i also didn't get any weird smell from this shirt nor did i think the material was too stiff.,Blouses
1,I have no idea why this has bad reviews! how is there any left?! this is a beautiful piece that i had to have in both the navy and green. i love that it comes with a cami. it&#39;s very flattering and not too wide or boxy. the lace detail is amazing! i bought my usual size and it fits perfect. love this top!!,Blouses
1,I did not have the issue that a previous reviewer did  there were ruffles on my shirt. the one thing i didn't know was how wide the top ran. i ordered my usual size 8 and it fit with no problems. i'm a 36b. the only thing is that in the model shot  the shirt is tucked into the pants and you don't get to see the full volume of it. even the model shot of the shirt from the back doesn't show the wide sleeves and body of the shirt. its not a big problem  since the shirt can be tucked but i will have,Blouses
1,Tts and very feminine and flattering. looks same as on model. love this style. if you like style highly recommend . armholes not too big- yay!,Blouses
1,A gorgeous and vibrant print! love the ruffles on the bottom and the detailing of the straps in the back. perfect for a beach day!,Blouses
-1,I saw this dress in the catalog and immediately ran to the store to purchase. then i realized the dress in the catalog is slightly different  but the small differences is what makes the catalog dress so much more unique and worth the money! look at the top  the stripe colors are different. and the stripes flow different on the skirt part as well. and the dress was short on me and i'm two inches shorter than the model. bummer.,Dresses
-1,This dress had so much potential but the horizontal knit ruined it. i tried on size xxs in grey since my usual petite xxs size was not available. the fabric was a good weight and dress was well constructed. however  the wide horizontal knit made the dress bulge out at places especially in the lower body thus made me look wide and bulky. i wish they had used a cable knit pattern which will make the dress drape much more nicely and more flattering.,Dresses
-1,Way too big and had a granny like styling. was very excited but ultimately took it back.,Dresses
-1,I'm 5 feet 120 and hourglass figure. i literally burst out laughing when i opened the package. i ordered my usual small petite. the dress is so short and small you would have to be 4 feet 90 pounds. returning.,Dresses
-1,I usually love maeve and generally feel like everything they make was made for me. sadly  this dress is a definite exception  which could easily have been solved by changing the construction of the dress. as other reviewers stated  the dress does run small  but even if you size up  if you have any breasts at all  the dress will pull at the buttons  causing them to gape (i'm only a b cup  so not on the large side.) i'm pretty sure this is why the model has her arms crossed in the picture. i love,Dresses
-1,I opened the package and the dress is two pieces. it is the skirt part with an orange cami top that the sweater goes over. the sweater was too short for me  as i am busty and would not work. i ordered my normal size and the band around the rib cage did not go from side to side so i didn't try it on.,Dresses
-1,Here's an example of lowering a hemline and slapping the term 'petite' on it. too much fabric  was bulky  and ran too small. the fabric was thin and pulled awkwardly over the bust. returned..,Dresses
-1,"As soon as i saw this dress online i loved it and ordered it! unfortunately it just didn't work for me  i tried it in a small  medium and large. for reference i'm 5'2""  145lbs  36d. the dress is really pretty in person  but i looked like a little girl in it. my daughter who is 4'9""  100lbs  34a  also tried it on and she too looked like a little girl in it. the material is beautiful along with the detail at the neckline  however the neckline is not open like in the picture  it's more pushed toget",Dresses
-1,I thought this dress looked so cute and comfortable and was excited to try it on  and i was majorly disappointed. it was incredibly unflattering  in every way. as a few of the other reviewers mentioned  if you have any sort of bust the dress will not hang nicely  the waist band was too high up and made me look pregnant. i'm 5'2 and curvy and usually take a lg in retailer  but this...ewww! i will say the color and material are gorgeous  but i'm guessing this is the type of dress that would look bes,Dresses
0,"I bought the blue dress  though the ""blue"" dress was a little more like grey according to my husband and i. the quality of the fabric was quite nice.    i have to return the dress because it does not fit me around the bust. i consider myself to have a good size bust (not huge)  but the dress seems to expect quite a bit smaller.     i was initially attracted to the dress because it looked a little more casual  which is what i wanted  but i guess i just wouldn't call it at all pretty.",Dresses
0,The dress is not like pictured. it is above the knee and sleeves are neither 3/4 nor full length-somewhere in between. i am 5'4  112 lbs  bought xs regular. had higher expectations for the price. going back to the store.,Dresses
0,Loved the pattern and colors of this dress. the material was extremely heavy. the shoulders and across the back was very small so that i couldn't lift my arms or put them out straight in front of me. but then the rest of the dress was huge and shapeless. sadly i had to return it.,Dresses
0,This dress did not work for me. i tried it in my bigger size 6 since i am coming off winter weight gain. the dress fit tts but was squishing the breasts like tight bandages. i have smaller chest and the stretch bodycon fabric of the bodice made me look flat-chested. the straps did not sit flat on shoulders  i assume because they were not pulled tight enough by the chest. the dress was uncomfortable and felt strange on. but i can see how others with more curves on top will love the support of the,Dresses
0,"As previously mentioned  this dress runs very large. i ordered accordingly  and the small was the right size for my frame  but it was just not flattering. i'm pear shaped  and i found the shoulders to be large  the neck a bit too high  and the overall cut to hug my figure in a very unflattering way. i'm 5'4""  140-ish  and maybe if i were a few pounds lighter and a few inches taller  it could've worked. i so wanted to love this  because it's soft and comfortable and cute  but back it goes.",Dresses
0,I love the color blocking but dress hangs a little strange on me. love the pockets  thought about sending it back and decided it is very comfortable  i will wear it but not quite what i was hoping for.,Dresses
0,This dress is beautiful. very vibrant and rich looking...however  after wearing it to work the back of the dress was completely stretched out from sitting in my office chair. when i stood up a little bubble remained around my butt. not attractive. i wanted to love it but it's going back.,Dresses
0,Beautiful dress  wonderful fabric  very well made  just runs really small! so sad  i wanted this dress for a special event!,Dresses
0,I loved this dress the minute i tried it on and am actually really sad that i had to return it. however  the embroidery was unraveling in several places before i'd even worn it  so i thought it would probably only get worse. too bad because it's gorgeous and flattering!,Dresses
1,This dress is comfortable and a great go to dress to wear to work and then after for drinks with friends.,Dresses
1,I think this dress is adorable . it fits great. wear it with heels or cowboy boots. you will not be disappointed,Dresses
1,Normally i would take a size 0 or xs in dresses  but after reading the reviews i am glad i took a size larger. the 2p worked out very nicely and i am 5'3 102lbs. it is a bit stiff when i walk around in it and losses some of its shape. don't get me wrong but i love the dress and am always receiving compliments on it.,Dresses
1,I purchased this dress for my 31st birthday and i am so glad that i did! i saw it in my local retailer store and immediately had to try it on! it is very flattering because i am 5'0  usually a size 8 or 10 in dresses and it fit perfect! the material is light  definitely suggest delicate cycle and hang-drying  but it is nice because you can layer this dress with a vest or coat! highly recommend this dress!,Dresses
1,"I ordered this dress to wear to a mid summer evening wedding. i love it. i think it will be fun  and it is unexpected for me. i will need to order a smaller size.i am 5'-5"" and almost always wear a 4 in retailer wear. this ran a little big on the top  i will be ordering a 2 and sending one back",Dresses
1,Knitted & knotted are my new bff. their sweater dresses are amazing and i'm now tracking down sold out versions of their apparel to enhance my closet and have a party. i adore (and drool...just a lil bit) this dress. the colors and styling and warmth make me happy. i sized up to a l because of my linebacker shoulders/broad bust (thanks retailer user reviewers!) i am comfy as long as i don't flail or flap. my one teeny tiny little complaint is right out of the factory cellophane bag  i had a loose,Dresses
1,Such an easy to wear and nicely cut summer dress. it does not wrinkle  has pretty colors and fits very well. i haven't washed it yet  but i like the idea that it can be machine washed. highly recommend. the fabric is good quality  a little bit thick for hot days though.,Dresses
1,I stared at this dress for a long time online and finally went into the store and tried it on. it is a beautiful quality and material. note that it is ivory  not pure white  which is exactly what i was looking for. the fit is more of an a-line and it is slightly long which is part of the style of the dress. i am taking it with me to a beach vacation in mexico but i plan to wear to many more occasions because this could easily be dressed up or down. just don't wear it to a wedding since it is a w,Dresses
1,I've been looking for a dress to wear to wedding this summer  and this is it. the blue color is lovely and the lace overlay is feminine and pretty. i'm small busted (34aa) with an athletic lower body (think  120-lb marathoner)  and the flare of this dress is perfect. i ordered this in a 0 and a 0 petite. the petite size looked little-girl short; the regular size hit just at my knee and was much more sophisticated. the waistband also fell at a more flattering place in the regular dress. i'm on th,Dresses

-1,And not in a good way. everywhere i went  i left a little of this sweater behind. within hours of having it on  i was picking balls of fabric off the couch  bed  and the sweater itself looked like it was molting. great style  fabric and fit (although a little on the long side ) but there's no way i can keep it.,Fine gauge

-1,This has such awful proportions. i'm 5'0 and 100 lbs  ordered xxs petite (in the neutral color). the seam at the bust literally hits in the middle of my bust!! it looks very unflattering  and it's very pronounced. i'm only 5'0 and already the seam hits at such a high point on me. below the seam the sweater is all scrunched up where it's sewed  and it balloons outward and is very square from there down. very shapeless sweater and not flattering at all unless you have your arms by your sides to hi,Fine gauge
-1,This is not even a dolman style sweater because it's loose fitting everywhere around the arm. the point of a dolman sweater is that the sleeves are fitted around the wrist/forearm  but this is not the case with this sweater. it's super loose around the wrist area - i can fit both of my wrists into a sleeve.,Fine gauge
-1,It's thin knit with a unique and pretty neckline  but unfortunately it's scratchy will not last. i just received it and it looks like it would fall apart after a few wears. it's a nice shade of offwhite at least. for me it's a no that will get sent back straight away.,Fine gauge
-1,"This top looks great on the model -- a petite frame  small-busted body.  i am 5'2"" and have a large bust and curvy hips. this top hit in all the wrong places. the front looks very cropped and frumpy  if you have a large bust. the width of the top of very boxy.  the top is very soft and comfortable and the color is pretty.",Fine gauge

0,This top is lovely  but fits like a crop top -- and i'm very short-waisted. i wore it with high-waisted jeans and was tugging at it all day. i think it will probably work better with a skirt. the colors are beautiful; it has a nice retro vibe. recommended if you don't mind the crop factor.,Fine gauge
0,First of all i love cashmere so by default i love this sweater shawl. the photos are a bit odd because you can wear it two different ways. if you wear it so it's long in front then the back comes up a bit higher and vice versa. my only big complaint is that i've worn it twice and there's already a large hole in the arm seam. poor construction which is disappointing. hopefully mine was a one-off. i'd recommend it but definitely wait for a sale.,Fine gauge

0,I love this piece because of its flattering stripes.i am 5' 9''  150 lbs and ordered a medium. the large was just too big  the small too short and tight  but the medium fit well. however  the sleeves are a little large which was a disappointment  and because of this there's an awkward excess of fabric on the front next to the armpits. i also experienced that the shirt is not long enough to tuck in  how the model has done.,Fine gauge
1,I ordered xs/petite but i think i better ordered xxs which was already sold out at the time i purchased. i recommend one size smaller for this sweater. this sweater is designed very wide for your shoulder which could be fallen down for people who usually prefer petite size but it's really adorable!!,Fine gauge
1,I passed this over on first sight because it looked like it might be on the short side in length. after seeing a few other photos and reading the reviews  i opted to give it a go. the store did not have my usual xs or even a size small  so i tried on the medium. it was too wide as expected  but the shoulders are adjustable so i fiddled with it a bit and decided it was really cute. there were no more xs available to order so i asked if the store could order the small. it arrived and is absolutely,Fine gauge

1,Don't judge the sweater by the model. it's an unattractive ensemble. the sweater is very pretty on. it's lightweight with a cute design on the back. i wear with skinny jeans or leggings. it runs a bit wide at shoulders but i'm petite so it could just be me. also  it says dry clean i think. but i put in a mesh bag and washed on delicate cycle by itself. then laid flat to dry and it was fine.,Fine gauge

-1,3 tags sewn in  2 small (about 1'' long) and 1 huge (about 2'' x 3''). very itchy so i cut them out. then the thread left behind was plasticy and even more itchy! how can you make an intimates item with such itchy tags? not comfortable at all! also - i love bralettes and wear them all the time including to work. i am a b cup. however  this one is so thin and flimsy that it gives no support even to a b cup - so for me this would only be a lounging bralette - if it wasn't so itchy!,Intimates
-1,The first time i wore this tank it started pilling around the arms and down the sides. it is terribly quality  and gets worse with every wear and wash. possibly the worst wear on a new clothing item i've ever seen. like the design and fit  immediately relegated it to a weekend/home shirt because it was unprofessionally pilly and the pills are small so can't be shaved off.,Intimates
0,I really was looking forward to this piece but unfortunately it was too small to even pass through my head nevertheless i couldn't even get both arms in. i got a size small and probably needed a large; but as far as the quality and color  it's really pretty! just go up a size or two if anything and try it out.,Intimates
0,I'm a b-cup who hates traditional underwire bras  so i was excited to try this one out. while i appreciate that this bra has more structure and support than other wireless comfy bras  the cups provided too much coverage for my style. if you want to wear a shirt with a wide neck  or do a cute off-the-shoulder thing with your shirt  the top of the cup shows. bummer!,Intimates
0,I wanted to love these because they are so pretty and come in lots of colors  but after only a few minutes of wearing them  i was having to pull them out of my bottom! why does women's underwear so frequently ride up? i normally wear a size 4/28  and ordered these in a m  but i guess they were still too small  which seems unreasonable to me. they are soft and pretty  but i will not be ordering more.,Intimates

0,This is pretty and provides coverage with a bit of support for wearing around the house. i'm a 34b so i ordered the small- it still had room in it so i tightened the straps and used the tightest hooks on the back  and that makes it fit ok. i bought it just to wear at home since i was not expecting a great deal of support or shaping  and while it feels ok it is not super-comfy- it's a bit scratchy around the edges. i was going to buy another color if i loved this  but as it is i will keep the one,Intimates
0,If your hips are bigger than a size 6 us you can't fully close this robe. the model must be wearing the larger of the two sizes to have such a nice oversized fit. the fabric is soft and lux and amazing  but the weird dart in the back and the closure is right over my sadly size 8 hips and butt. if i was taller and thinner i would have kept this and worn it every day.,Intimates

1,This piece fits true to size and is very flattering on. sometimes i worry about my stomach not being perfectly flat  but this wasn't an issue at all  probably because of the intricate lace details. the fabric is substantial enough that i don't feel like it'll get a hole in it after multiple wears.,Intimates
1,I own many of the natori feathers back close bras and decided to try the front close version for spring/summer tops and dresses. i purchased the yellow and got the matching hipsters panty. i no longer see the yellow available but you could find elsewhere or maybe retailer will bring this color back (it is lovely!)? for sizing  i tried my normal size (34b) and the cup size larger per other reviews. the 34c did end up fitting better so i also recommend going up a cup size. excited for warmer weather,Intimates

1,I got the burgundy color and i do have to say that the color looks a little better online than it does in person  but it's not too much of a difference. this is a really cute thong  and if you're just trying to be sexy/romantic  then i think it would be fine and there's nothing at all wrong with it. however  i like to wear thongs just in general because i think they're comfortable and i like not having to worry about panty lines  and this is definitely not the most comfortable. the front pattern,Intimates
-1,I generally don't write bad reviews  but there is a real discrepancy between the quality of this kimono and the cost. the design and colors are great  but the fabric is ripping on all the kimonos on the rack in my store where the manufacturer's tag is at the back of the neck. the material is very thin  so there are other small holes beginning throughout the garment. i shop at retailer all the time  and this is not a $98 item of clothing.,Jackets

-1,After reading the previous reviews i thought sizing down would be a great idea. as soon as i pulled it out of the bag i knew that the xs/s was still wayyy too big. for reference i am 5'3 and a 34ddd and usually wear an 8 but this thing was enormous. it was shapeless and boxy but done so horribly it looked like i was pregnant. it has an adjustable draw string at the bottom which helps to make you look like a balloon. such a disappointment. the design was lovely and it looked very high quality and,Jackets

-1,This looks great on the model but when it arrived  i couldn't believe it was the same jacket. it looks a bit like a really loose garbage bag on me and no amount of adjusting drawstrings is going to fix it. i really wanted to like it  but even the xs/s was too baggy. also a bit worried based on other reviews that it isn't actually a rain jacket and wont keep you dry.,Jackets

0,I don't mind loose-fitting clothing  but to say that this product runs large is an understatement. no amount of pulling  tying  pinching could help me get this jacket to fall the way it does on the model in the photo. the arm holes are a foot in diameter for artistic purposes  and the jacket itself is meant to flow far away from the body  i guess. if you try to taper it in with the strings  then end result resembles a rounded beach ball. very disappointed  especially since the design on the fabr,Jackets

-1,I was extremely excited to receive these pants  given the two positive reviews. i'm a petite woman and have trouble finding jeans with the right proportions. i sized down from my normal size (27 to a 26) and was swimming in these pants. i would have had to go down three sizes to make these work. i'm not sure if i received a defective pair or what  but be cautious ordering these pants.,Jeans

1,I bought these in light grey and navy. they are both beautiful. high quality very flattering  and so comfortable! i love them! they're a perfect long length. i have long legs and it can be challenging finding a good length in pants. the pockets are deep and functional  which is rare in women's pants. they are more than i like to spend  but i will get a lot of wear out of them. they look and feel fantastic. i highly recommend these!,Jeans
-1,This top has a nice design. i love the lace up back which makes it much more adjustable in shape. if you lace it lower it is more flattering to your waist. however the fabric quality is very poor on the white tank. it arrived with a small tear in the front hem area  which i could have easily fixed. it is very sheer; even with a nude bra  my bra was too visible for my comfort. plan on wearing a full camisole underneath  tank  or bralette you are fine with being on display.,Knits

-1,Wow! this sure is close fitting  as in suction cups to your body! yikes  definitely not forgiving for those of us with curves. to me  it seems like the material will wear well. i bought this for a great sales price so i may keep it  not sure. it would work fine as a layering piece but if i gain even 5 lbs  it won't work. i ordered the medium and am usually a small. the large might have worked best but probably still pretty clingy. i do recommend this if you are thin with no problem areas.,Layering
0,This seemed to run a little bit small on me... more form fitting than on the model in the photo. also  it's thin. i'd be sold on it for sure if it were just a little longer too because i like the almost-lingerie-like look. the lace applique is pretty  and if you purchase it for that  then it really shows up better on the two lighter colors - it really gets lost all in black.,Layering

0,I loved this when i got it. it has such a flattering fit! slightly loose in the body  but not flowy. nice weight of fabric. comfortable fabric. perfect scoop neck that doesn't show too much cleavage. but i washed it once on delicate and line dried (which i do with most of my shirts) and it came out riddled in holes.,Layering
0,"I like this shirt  as in general i prefer more form-fitting and less flowy shirts. however  after washing the shirt and hanging dry it has shrunk to be too short to wear with even mid-rise jeans. so: good if you don't like long t-shirts  bad if you are tall  like me (5'8"") and don't want to wear a crop top.",Layering
0,"This spandex top  in my opinion  is workout wear. it is not the tank i expected to receive  but my bad. it is super stretchy tank like most folks use with leggings or workout shorts. it does seem small but perhaps due to the kind of tank it is  it should fit like this. 5' 5"" 142 lbs medium is skin tight. color is nice but  as i wanted a tank to wear with skirts or jeans and this is not what i had envisioned-it has to go back to retailer. quality seems fair.",Layering

0,I nearly always wear a size small  and sometimes even a small is too large. not in this case; this top is extremely snug. i would not be able to wear this  and i would've returned for a larger size but the ivory color was a little too yellow for me. in the online photo. the color is more of an off-white than ivory yellow. i'm guessing also that this fabric may not stand the test of time and easily snag. but that's just conjecture.,Layering

1,The size s arm holes are a little too over-sized and i find i keep adjusting the shoulders so the sides of my bra won't show (and sizing down to an xs made the body too tight). it's a bit pricey for a basic  thin tank  but it's a good every day  wear all the time staple.,Layering

1,I purchased the turquoise in a petite- xs. normally items at retailer run on the larger side and this shirt fit just right (i am 4ft 11inches and 100lbs). the material was a little on the lite side which makes a great summer fit  but it is a bit weak (so it can tear easily). it looks great with all types of skirts and jeans. i just wish retailer would sell more of the petite sizes. i went back in to buy more in other colors and they are sold out already!,Layering

1,I love this style of tank top with the wider straps. very flattering but yes the armholes are big and i noticed the sizing is different with each color. i normally wear an xs but in the gray and blue i bought s to have a little room. i also bought the black color but the s was huge! i exchanged for an xs so hopefully it will fit better. it had to be ordered. it definitely stretches out as you wear it though.,Layering
1,Love this top! i'm 5'7  145 pounds  athletic build  and the medium falls slightly loosely and very nicely over my hips. it is quite low cut  so i wear a tank under it in a professional environment  but it's fine to wear sans tank top in a more casual setting. i really love the back  as the straps are sexy and show off my shoulders. the material seems to be good quality  and i would order this in more colors if it were available!,Layering

1,Run to purchase this jacket. i am in love. it surpassed my wildest expectations when it arrived. beautiful coloration  comfortable fit  fantastic fabric and gorgeous collar. i am so glad that i ordered it. please use this exact same design and offer this same jacket in other colors and patterns. i can't say enough good things about this item.,Outerwear
1,I agree with the other reviews that the side slits are not at all represented in the images. thankfully there was an instagram photo of the coat posted by the time i ordered it that showed the side panels very clearly  so i was not caught off guard. i like that the panels allow for ease of movement  but when there's a cold wind it would be nice if they were not there. this coat is a great statement piece for a night out  just not as much for day to day wear if you're looking for something warm a,Outerwear
1,This arrived in my store this morning and it is as cute as it appears online!! i'm a curvy gal so i honestly wasn't feeling like this would look good on me. but it is thick and the fabric is sturdy so it lays on me exactly the way it does on the model! the fabric on the blue side almost has a vinyl feel to it...like it would be rainproof! the sherpa layer is super soft and in my opinion  even cuter than the blue side! the trim is all lined with a faux leather and the ties on each side can be adj,Outerwear

-1,I bought a pair of these a month ago and first time i washed them they came out with light spots all down the leg. i figured i did something wrong so i bought another pair in the same color and one in sage. just washed both pairs according to care instructions (no spills  stain remover  or anything but detergent) and both came out with light spots all down the leg. very sad to have wasted all that money.,Pants
